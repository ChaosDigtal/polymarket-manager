Hi Jason,

I understand your situation, and I appreciate you sharing it with me. However, I hope you understand that the rate of $30â€“$40 you suggested is a bit tight considering my current rate. That said, I truly enjoyed working with you, so I have a suggestion.

Would you be open to working outside of Upwork? This would allow us to exclude their fees and make instant payments easier for me. If this works for you, please feel free to email me at digitalchaos2002@gmail.com.

Thank you,
Tejas
